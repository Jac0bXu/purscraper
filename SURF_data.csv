A microfluidics approach for detecting alpha-synuclein seeds in biospecimens from Parkinsons disease patients,"Seed amplification assays (SAAs) are a powerful method to detect alpha-synuclein (aSyn) aggregates (or seeds) in biospecimens from Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. These assays capitalize on the ability of misfolded aSyn seeds in a biospecimen to induce the aggregation of recombinant aSyn monomers into fibrils, which can then be detected using a fluorescent dye. One of the primary limitations of SAAs is their long duration, resulting from a prolonged lag time before detectable aggregation occurs. To address this challenge, our group aims to optimize several assay parameters to reduce the overall assay time. Specifically, the SURF involved in this project will examine various solution conditions, adjust the amount of input biospecimen, use different extraction steps to clean up the biospecimen, and test different recombinant aSyn variants as the monomeric form added to the assay. Beyond these optimizations, the student (along with graduate students in our lab) will collaborate with Purdue engineers who specialize in injectors and microfluidics to further accelerate the templated aggregation process central to the SAA. By incorporating advanced microfluidic techniques, we aim to enhance the efficiency of seed-monomer interactions and reduce the time required for fibril formation. Our multi-faceted approach is designed to make SAAs a faster and more reliable diagnostic tool, ultimately improving the early detection and monitoring of PD.",West Lafayette,Other,U.S. Citizen,No Major Restriction,Medicinal Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology,Chris Rochet,https://www.mcmp.purdue.edu/faculty/jrochet
Acoustic and Electric-Fields to Enhance Membrane Filtration in Water and Air,"This interdisciplinary project explores innovative technologies for separation processes, integrating acoustic forces and electric-field interactions with membranes to address critical challenges in air and water purification. The research combines fluid mechanics, catalysis, aerosol transport, and optics principles to develop high-efficiency filtration and separation systems. The technology aims to protect human health and sustainability through new capabilities to remove bioaerosols (e.g. containing viruses), smoke from fires and fossil fuels, and contaminants in the water. Acoustic Forces for Air Filtration Acoustic air cleaning leverages acoustic standing waves and streaming forces to manipulate aerosol movement within flowing streams. By harnessing these forces, it becomes possible to control the transport and capture of aerosols, including particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and other airborne pollutants. This project aims to enhance the performance of fiber filters by using acoustic forces to direct aerosols toward filter fibers, addressing challenges associated with the most penetrating particle sizes (MPPS).Currently, a bench-scale experimental setup is under construction to validate these findings. This setup will include: Generation of realistic aerosols to simulate real-world particle size distributions. Integration of acoustic filtration devices within a controlled airflow duct. Measurement of particle concentrations upstream and downstream to evaluate filtration performance. Electric-Field Interaction for Water Filtration This component focuses on self-generated electric fields in membranes submerged in aqueous solutions, where catalytic reactions at membrane surfaces drive fluid flow. The project aims to understand and optimize the interactions between electric fields and fluid transport by coupling electrokinetic effects with advanced separation techniques. Particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) will be employed to visualize and quantify the flow behavior near the membranes. Membrane related technologies Synthetic membranes are ubiquitous in various fields, such as separation processes, desalination, and reactor systems. We are developing innovative methods for high-efficiency air conditioning, using water vapor-selective membranes for dehumidification. With new process designs and novel material enhancements, such a technology can provide significant energy savings for buildings. Since HVAC operations account for nearly 20% of the primary energy consumed in the US, developing more efficient cooling systems is a significant target for combating global warming and resource depletion. We also investigate whether current membrane distillation (MD) systems can be made more efficient. This includes work on the effect of tilt angle on air gap MD performance, system optimization, new modeling techniques for MD, superhydrophobic condensing for MD, and design of multistage MD systems.  The analysis for these systems includes thermodynamic and heat transfer modeling with Engineering Equation Solver, designing and building experimental systems for testing heat transfer enhancements and the efficiency of new configurations.",West Lafayette,"Energy and Environment, Engineering the Built Environment, Fluid Modelling and Simulation, Material Modeling and Simulation, Material Processing and Characterization, Nanotechnology",No citizenship requirements,Mechanical Engineering Civil Engineering Chemical Engineering Materials Engineering,School of Mechanical Engineering,David Warsinger,www.warsinger.com

All-Optical Neural Networks for Artificial Intelligence,"Machine learning techniques, particularly those based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), have significantly advanced fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, as well as fundamental studies in physics and materials science. Despite considerable advancements in AI algorithms and hardware optimizations aimed at reducing model sizes and accelerating inference and training processes, most efforts have thus far concentrated on traditional electronic systems, including CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs. These systems, while powerful, consume substantial amounts of energy and are unable to meet the increasing demands of rapidly growing data volumes, especially as we approach the limits of Moore's Law. Optical implementation of AI modules, such as optical neural networks (ONNs), presents a compelling alternative that leverages inherent parallelism, high-speed computation, and potential for low energy consumption. Notably, recent studies show that the energy cost of optical implementations has the potential to be 2?? orders of magnitude less than that of state-of-the-art CMOS implementations. The wave nature and superposition principle of light enables natural parallel processing, such as performing matrix-vector multiplications in constant time?? stark contrast to the quadratic time complexity of digital electronic processors. Additionally, ONNs can execute complex-valued arithmetic by encoding information in both the phase and magnitude of light, further exploiting the unrivaled speed of light as an information carrier. In this project, the SURF undergraduate student will work with a graduate student to develop both opto-electronic hardware and software for implementing an all-optical neural network, and apply it for AI applications. I expect the SURF undergraduate student play the same role as a graduate student, and have opportunities for coauthor-ship and coinventor-ship.",West Lafayette,"Advanced Packaging, Deep Learning, Other",No citizenship requirements,Electrical Engineering Physics Computer Engineering Computer Science,Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Shengwang Du,https://engineering.purdue.edu/QuantumOptics

Antibiotic peptide encapsulation into nanoparticles for improved drug delivery,"Biologics ??peptide, protein, and nucleic acid therapeutics ??are highly potent drug molecules that selectively interact with biological markers, thus reducing off-target side effects. Effective biologic therapies (1) reach the site of action intact and (2) sustain therapeutic concentrations at the site of action. Accomplishing these objectives is challenging due to potential degradation under physiological conditions, specifically pH, enzymes, and surfactants, which can limit therapeutic efficacy. Processing biologics into nanoparticles (NPs) is an attractive approach to overcoming these delivery challenges, with demonstrated commercial success for mRNA in the COVID-19 lipid nanoparticle vaccines. The Ristroph Lab at Purdue University has developed an effective method for efficiently encapsulating peptides and proteins into polymeric NPs at large scales that relies on hydrophobic ion pairing (HIP). HIP is a solubility engineering technique that electrostatically complexes a charged hydrophilic molecule with a hydrophobic counterion to produce a water-insoluble salt that can then be encapsulated via Flash Nanoprecipitation (FNP). When this technique is used to encapsulate peptides and proteins, the biologic-counterion complex precipitated in NP cores forms liquid crystalline structures (LCs) that depend on the counterion and environmental pH. Previous work demonstrated different LC phases control peptide/protein release in vitro. The assembly kinetics and dynamics of LC structures in the cores of polymeric NPs and the design rules governing these different LC phases and, thus, peptide/protein release remain to be elucidated. Sustained release NP formulations for proteins and peptides produced using this technique have several advantages over the delivery of unencapsulated biologics. First, controlled-release formulations increase the residence time of the biologic in the body, potentially decreasing the amount of injected biologic required to achieve a therapeutic effect. Additionally, the biocompatible block co-polymer shell can (1) protect the core material from harsh environmental conditions and (2) be modified to sustain further the release of the biologic from the core. The combination of HIP and FNP can uniquely enable the co-delivery of biologics and hydrophobic small-molecule drugs to have a synergistic effect. To capitalize on the advantages listed above and generate optimized formulations for biologic therapies, a deeper understanding of the relationship between HIP parameters, liquid crystal structure, and release of the biologic is required. This project will focus primarily on quantifying the release rate of a model peptide antibiotic therapeutic from polymeric nanocarriers that have been measured for internal structural information already. The researcher will then work with a graduate mentor to develop correlations between drug release and internal structure.",West Lafayette,Nanotechnology,No citizenship requirements,No Major Restriction,Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering,Kurt Ristroph,https://www.ristrophlab.com/

CISTAR - Decarbonization of the High-Carbon Intensive and High-Volume Commodity Chemicals Production through Renewable Electrification,"This project is supported by CISTAR, an NSF Engineering Research Center headquartered at Purdue Electrification of industrial processes is being frequently mentioned as an option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from energy-intensive industries. Electricity is a versatile energy carrier which presents a variety of electrification options. The increasing availability of cheap renewable electricity provides an opportunity to decarbonize energy intensive processes. As part of this decarbonization effort, the commodity chemical industry is an important target due to its large energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions. One potential paradigm for electrification involves replacing the use of steam, generated by burning fossil fuels, as a source of heat in chemical processes to processes with direct electrical heating using renewable energy sources. This project aims to identify and quantify areas where energy is currently transferred by steam can be efficiently transferred by renewable electrification.

Characterizing Infant Exposure to Chemical Contaminants in Indoor Dust,"Our project is funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and involves an interdisciplinary collaboration between engineers, chemists, and psychologists at Purdue University and New York University (NYU). We will elucidate determinants of indoor dust ingestion in 6- to 24-month-old infants (age range for major postural and locomotor milestones). Specific objectives are to test: (1) whether the frequency and characteristics of indoor dust and non-dust mouthing events change with age and motor development stage for different micro-environments; (2) how home characteristics and demographic factors affect indoor dust mass loading and dust toxicant concentration; (3) how dust transfer between surfaces is influenced by dust properties, surface features, and contact dynamics; and (4) contributions of developmental, behavioral, and socio-environmental factors to dust and toxicant-resolved dust ingestion rates. In addition, the project will (5) create a shared corpus of video, dust, toxicant, and ingestion rate data to increase scientific transparency and speed progress through data reuse by the broader exposure science community. Our transdisciplinary work will involve: (1) parent report questionnaires and detailed video coding of home observations of infant mouthing and hand-to-floor/object behaviors; (2) physical and chemical analyses of indoor dust collected through home visits and a citizen-science campaign; (3) surface-to-surface dust transfer experiments with a robotic platform; (4) dust mass balance modeling to determine distributions in and determinants of dust and toxicant-resolved dust ingestion rates; and (5) open sharing of curated research videos and processed data in the Databrary digital library and a public website with geographic and behavioral information for participating families. The project will provide improved estimates of indoor dust ingestion rates in pre-sitting to independently walking infants and characterize inter-individual variability based on infant age, developmental stage, home environment, and parent behaviors. Dust transport experiments and modeling will provide new mechanistic insights into the factors that affect the migration of dust from the floor to mouthed objects to an infant?? mouth.

Development of a controlled-release nanocarrier formulation against opioid exposure,"A majority of the drug overdose fatalities in the United States are due to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl and heroin. There is at present only one FDA-approved treatment for opioid overdose: naloxone, an opioid receptor antagonist currently marketed as a nasal spray or as an intramuscular injection. The low half-life of naloxone in the body significantly limits the therapeutic windows of these formulations, particularly against long-lasting synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. This in turn necessitates multiple consecutive doses of naloxone per patient over a sustained period of time, which leads to undesirable side effects and is logistically more difficult than a single-dose treatment would be. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate a sustained-release respiratory (nasal or pulmonary) naloxone nanocarrier formulation with a protective therapeutic window longer than the existing marketed intranasal formulation.

Dont bother the driver: Sensor-scheduling for cognitive state estimation during automated driving.,"During safety-critical human-automation interactions such as automated driving, knowledge of cognitive states such as the driver?? trust in the automation can help prevent automation misuse (over-reliance). However, unlike estimating the speed of a car, estimating a human?? cognitive state is not straightforward; it needs to be inferred from their behavior (usage of automation, eye-gaze), involuntary physiological responses (heart-rate), and what they self-report (to questions like ??ow much do you trust the automation???. Unlike recording data-streams from sensors such as a heart-rate monitor, it is not reasonable to ask the user to report their trust too frequently. The goal of this project is to enable development and testing of algorithms that schedule solicitation of self-reports only when absolutely required to reduce uncertainty in cognitive state estimates.

Environmental Impact Assessment of Noise Generated During Offshore Wind Foundation Installation,"Monopile foundations for offshore wind turbines are typically installed with large hydraulic hammers, generating very loud sounds that propagate through the ocean via the water and seafloor. This noise is known to induce behavioral change and (in some cases) auditory injury in marine animals up to 50 km away, including whales and other cetaceans that communicate at low frequencies. Our multidisciplinary research team is developing a new noise control technology for monopile foundation installation that combines active and passive noise abatement technologies. Lab-scale experiments show that our novel technology has the technical potential to reduce noise by an order of magnitude or more compared to state-of-the-art commercial solutions. If successfully scaled up and commercialized, this technology could reduce noise-related risks for ocean wildlife near offshore wind development sites. In this SURF project, the student researcher will collaborate in a research team that spans four engineering departments at Purdue (Mechanical Engineering, Civil & Construction Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Environmental & Ecological Engineering). This specific SURF opportunity is for a member of our Environmental Impact Assessment research sub-team. Under the guidance of faculty and graduate student research mentors, the SURF student will perform a holistic environmental impact assessment of the noises generated during pile-driving of monopile wind turbine foundations, and will assess the potential for these impacts to be mitigated through noise-abatement technologies (commercially available and our novel solution). This project will involve the use of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) and other impact assessment techniques.

Gradual Verification: Software Assurance Incrementally,"Description and Significance: Software verification is the process of ensuring that a piece of software does what it is intended to do (i.e., ensuring the code adheres to its specification). Software verification is important for all software systems, but particularly so, for critical systems such as control systems for aircraft and nuclear power plants. However, static verification---the technique often applied to such systems---cannot support incrementality. It involves writing detailed specifications (often in a formal logic) on system components, such as pre- and postconditions for functions. To prove that a function adheres to its postcondition (e.g. that a findMax function returns the maximal element of a list), tools demand many additional specifications. Worse even, is that a single specification cannot be checked for correctness without providing all the required specifications. The idea of Gradual verification [1,2,3,4] was introduced to solve this problem and make static verification more useful in practice. Gradual verification supports the incremental specification and verification of programs through the sound and principled application of static (at compile-time) and dynamic (at run-time) techniques---static techniques are applied where possible and dynamic ones where necessary. As a result, a gradual verifier allows developers to pick and choose which properties and components of their system to specify without any unnecessary effort and receive immediate verification feedback. Since the introduction of gradual verification [1], we have extended the approach to support more practical programs, such as those containing recursive heap data structures (trees, graphs, lists, etc.) [2,3,4]. Student Involvement: Students who work with me this summer will have the opportunity to work on a gradual verification project of their choosing. I have several interesting new projects for gradual verification that involve theory, building tools, and/or studying human behavior. For example, I am interested in how machine learning and large language models can be used to generate specifications supported by gradual verification. I am also interested in building a gradual verifier for the C programming language and exploring the educational impact of gradual verification through user studies. See the projects page on my website for detailed project information: https://jennalwise.github.io/projects/. Each of these endeavors will allow students to gain experience with programming language design, software development, theory, formal reasoning, logic, and empirical studies. Additionally, my goal is for students who work with me this summer to present and/or publish their work at conferences (as many of my students have done in the past).

Home-based heat therapy in older adults with type 2 diabetes,"Our research project focuses on developing non-invasive, practical therapies to improve glycemic control, vascular function, and physical function in older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D), who are at elevated risk for cardiovascular disease and disability. Current therapeutic options, such as exercise, are underutilized by this population due to poor adherence. Therefore, we are exploring the potential of home-based heat therapy as a novel approach. Heat therapy has shown promise in improving metabolic health, blood glucose regulation, and skeletal muscle function in both animal models and humans. In this project, we aim to establish the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of 12 weeks of home-based leg heat therapy using water-circulating trousers in older adults with T2D. Participants will be randomized to either the heat therapy group (90 minutes daily at 42?C) or a sham control group (33?C). We will evaluate compliance, blood glucose regulation (HbA1c, insulin sensitivity), body composition, leg strength, and physical function. Additionally, we will assess endothelial function using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the popliteal artery. Endothelial dysfunction is an early indicator of atherosclerosis and is strongly correlated with cardiovascular risk factors, including T2D. This project offers undergraduate students the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research related to cardiovascular disease and diabetes, gain hands-on experience with clinical assessments, and work alongside a multidisciplinary team.

How does the assembly of PFAS affect its transport in soil,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) continue to present a management challenge, particularly at locations where aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) were used heavily. To improve the long-term management of AFFF-impacted sites, it is critical to understand the role of PFAS self-assembly in the source zones and the factors that impact this self-assembly on the long-term release and transport of PFAS to groundwater. This project aims to evaluate relevant environmental factors such as PFAS concentration and type, hydrocarbon co-surfactants, ionic matrix, and soil chemical/physical properties that affect the formation and stability of supramolecular systems within AFFF-source zones. We aim to understand the self-assembly of PFAS mixtures in solution and at the air/water and water/soil interfaces in the presence of hydrocarbon co-surfactants, co-solvents, and inorganic ions during wetting and drying cycles. We are seeking a highly motivated undergraduate student to work on this project. The primary responsibilities of the student will be to characterize the PFAS assembly in solution and surfaces using dynamic light scattering, tensiometry, and optical microscopy.

In vitro MRI phantoms for MRI data harmonization,"Four-dimensional Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D flow MRI) is an emerging non-invasive tool for measuring blood flow in the cardiovascular system. It provides velocity measurements that can be processed to quantify secondary flow aspects such as pressure and wall shear stress. Understanding these aspects is crucial for studying the progression of various cardiovascular diseases. However, its implementation across different MRI vendors poses a challenge due to intervendor differences in image resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), hindering longitudinal analysis. Data harmonization of MRI measurements can help overcome this limitation, enabling intervendor comparison and analysis of 4D flow MRI data. Selected student will contribute to a multidisciplinary project focused on developing flow phantoms for installation into flow loops.

Injectable biomaterials for cardiac tissue engineering applications,"Reinforcement of the myocardial wall with biomaterials can attenuate left-ventricular wall thinning and preserve cardiac function after myocardial infarction. However, introducing biomaterials into the myocardial wall is a critical challenge, since most naturally-derived and synthetic biomaterials are incompatible with delivery devices such as catheters. Similarly, injectable biomaterials including hydrogels and infusible grafts can disperse away after injection, reducing their protective and reparative effects. The goal of this project is to develop shear-thinning and self-healing biomaterials that are easy to inject, have suitable mechanical properties to support their retention at the site of injury, and have a porous structure to promote cell and tissue ingrowth during repair. Leveraging the current expertise in the Qazi lab, the student will use flow-focusing droplet-microfluidics and a photocurable polymer to develop injectable hydrogels. Mechanical properties will be controlled by varying crosslinker ratio, polymer concentration, and will be characterized using a dynamic mechanical analyzer. Hydrogel microparticles will be fabricated using a water-in-oil microfluidics device with downstream exposure to UV light. The particles will be assembled into injectable hydrogels via packing at high centrifugation speeds. Oscillatory shear rheology will be used to characterize shear-thinning and self-healing properties.

Integrated Biochemical and Physicochemical Processes to Recover Critical Metals from Municipal Solid Waste in Landfills,"In the United States, landfills containing municipal solid waste (MSW) represent a large repository of critical metals, particularly originating from discarded electronic waste (e-waste). To date, no known technologies have successfully recovered critical metals from landfills, which is uniquely challenged by the inability to directly access deposited materials. Landfill leachates present an opportunity to capture critical metals from the aqueous stream.  This SURF project will support a larger, integrated effort by addressing these specific research objectives: i) characterize the currently unknown critical metal content in existing US landfill leachates, and ii) elucidate the complex chemistry of metals in landfill leachates. No known studies have reported valued metal concentrations beyond those of heavy metals , ,  in US landfill leachates. Additionally, metal speciation is highly dynamic, since the landfill redox, pH, and ligand composition change over time as they mature and MSW undergoes biological, chemical, and physical transformations. The lack of knowledge of chemical speciation of each metal is a critical technical gap that will inhibit separation and recovery efforts. The SURF student will work with graduate student and faculty mentors on the following objectives and tasks: Elemental analysis: landfill leachate samples will be processed (including microwave assisted digestion) and elements will be detected and quantified with Inductively Coupled Plasma ??Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Water quality parameters: Total organic and inorganic carbon (HCO3- and CO32-) will be measured by a TOC analyzer, and dominant organic ligands (carboxylic acids and phenolic groups), measured via acid-base titration. These water quality parameters strongly influence the speciation of the elements. Modeling chemical speciation:. The typical composition of landfill leachate will include inorganic ligands, such as hydroxide (OH^-), chloride (Cl^-), bicarbonate ??HCO??3^-), carbonate (CO_3^(2-)), ammonia (NH_3), sulfate (SO_4^(2-)) and phosphate (PO_4^(3-)), along with many organic ligands, particularly short chain carboxylic acids. We will model metal speciation with tools such as Visual MINTEQ or MINEQL+ and compare: greatest to least MT among the seven metals, comparisons of chemical speciation (uncomplexed versus complexed), and ranges of conditions (pH, redox, ionic strength). Analytical results from including measurement of various ligand concentrations, the pH, the ionic strength, and the MT, will enable detailed predictions of species and concentrations.

Kagome embeddings on quantum hardware in search of new quantum phases of matter,"Kagome and Triangular lattices form the basis of a set of geometrically frustrated spin lattices where all the constraints of the Hamiltonian are not satisfied. This leads to unusual ground and excited states which show unique features such as magnetization plateaus and spin glass states. The problem becomes much more interesting in the quantum realm where quantum fluctuations adds to the frustration to lead to several new and exotic phases which are purely 'quantum', i.e. with no classical analog. These phases not only are of great interest to the condensed matter community as they are realized in real materials, but also in the quantum computing community as they help to benchmark the quantum hardware. In this project, we attempt to understand such interesting phases of matter using quantum computers accessible at Purdue University. We test the results against classical simulations to validate the result for small number of spins, and seek to unearth newer phases when the number of spins are larger. The goal of the project is to come up with predictions for Ising triangular lattices in a transverse field and deduce their phase transitions using quantum annealing and quenching in the pseudospin basis.",West Lafayette,Material Modeling and Simulation,No citizenship requirements,No Major Restriction,Physics and Astronomy,Arnab Banerjee,N/A

Localized Deep Learning for Decentralized and Dynamic Environments,"Despite being widely used, global end-to-end learning has several key limitations. It requires centralized computation, making it feasible only on a single device or a carefully synchronized cluster. This restricts its use on unreliable or resource-constrained devices, such as commodity hardware clusters or edge computing networks. Localized deep learning has the potential to develop highly decentralized, parallel, asynchronous, and fault-tolerant algorithms that can learn on heterogeneous hardware devices under dynamic conditions while maintaining comparable model performance. The long-term vision would be an ""Internet of AI"" where devices can continuously learn in any conditions. REU participants will be part of a collaborative team focused on developing novel localized deep learning approaches. The goal is to create a learning algorithm with local objectives that learns rich unsupervised representations in a highly decentralized and fault-tolerant way. As one specific context, suppose a sensor network should be trained to detect a complex or global event such as anomalous activity over a large area of the wilderness. Each sensor has a very incomplete picture of the situation and can communicate with nearby sensors but cannot communicate with a global centralized server. The goal is to implement both width-parallel and depth-parallel learning on an unreliable set of sensor devices that have limited compute power.

Mechano-transduction in progerin-expressing endothelial cells,"A mutant truncated form of lamin called progerin is responsible for premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). Interestingly, progerin is also found in normal adults, and increases with age. Defective nuclear lamina in aged cells share similarities with nuclei of HGPS cells such as distorted nuclear shape and increased mechano-sensitivity. HGPS patients share something else with older people: the progression of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. Endothelial cells in the vasculature are constantly exposed to hemodynamic forces of blood flow on the lumen side. The presence of progerin yielded stiff nucleus, but softer chromatin in nuclear interior, which probably contributed to decreased responsiveness to mechanical stress. In this project, we will develop an endothelial cell line that stably express GFP-fused wildtype lamin and progerin proteins. These cells will be used in flow experiments to examine the effect of shear stress on how progerin affect signaling transduction such as the AMPK pathway, and the subsequent effect on cell homeostasis and aging.

Multi-modal Capture of Symptoms Data from Speech or Text with Automatic Annotation to Continuous Analysis of Heart Rhythm: Application in the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes,"The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue that exhibit joint hypermobility and skin involvement, with other organs involved in varying degrees depending on the type of EDS.  The most common type, known as the hypermobile type, or hEDS, is still without a known genetic cause.  The manifestations of hEDS extend far beyond the musculoskeletal system and skin; aside from chronic pain, the most debilitating symptoms are due to autonomic nervous system (ANS) impairment.  The precise mechanisms leading to autonomic dysfunction in hEDS are not well understood.  Individuals with hEDS have hyper-elastic veins that allow up to 1/3 of the circulating blood volume to collect in the lower extremities upon standing. This can lead to diminished blood flow and oxygen-carrying capacity to the heart, lungs, and brain. A second possible mechanism is compression of the medulla due to craniocervical instability, which occurs when the tendons and ligaments that hold the head on the neck allow excessive movement between the skull and the cervical spine. Thirdly, people with hEDS are often living in constant pain, sending a consistent message to the brain that the body is under threat. This heightens the expression of the sympathetic ??ight-or-flight??nervous system. Since the parasympathetic nervous system mediates central coordination of ??est-and-digest??functions, heart rhythms, gastrointestinal motility, sleep, and quality-of-life are subsequently impaired.  Due to the rarity of this disease, there have been few long-term symptom profiling studies to understand the nature of symptoms with respect to autonomic dysfunction.

Physics-Informed Machine Learning to Improve the Predictability of Extreme Weather Events,"Atmospheric blocking events and 'Bomb Cyclones' are an important contributor to high impact extreme weather events. Both these weather extremes lead to heat waves, cold spells, droughts, and heavy precipitation episodes, which have dire consequences for the public health, economy, and ecosystem. For example, the blocking-induced heat waves of 2003 in Europe led to tens of thousands of human casualties and tens of billions of dollars of financial damage. Traditionally, prediction of extreme weather events is based on direct numerical simulation of regional or global atmospheric models, which are expensive to conduct and involve a large number of tunable parameters. However, with the rapid rise of data science and machine learning in recent years, this proposed work will apply convolutional neural network to an idealized atmospheric model to conduct predictability analysis of extreme weather events within this model. With this proposed machine-learning algorithm, our project will provide a robust forecast of heat waves and atmospheric blocking with a lead-time of a few weeks. With more frequent record-breaking heat waves in the future, such a prediction will offer a crucial period of time (a few weeks) for our society to take proper preparedness steps to protect our vulnerable citizens. This project is based on developing and verifying the machine learning algorithm for detecting extreme weather events in an idealized model. We will use Purdue?? supercomputer Bell to conduct the simulations. The undergraduate student will play an active and important role in running the idealized model, and participate in developing the algorithms.

To mitigate these impacts, it is crucial to measure the carbon intensity of the electricity grid. By predicting future carbon intensity, datacenter operators can optimize workload scheduling to minimize their carbon footprint by executing tasks during periods and in regions with lower carbon intensity. However, accurate carbon intensity prediction remains challenging due to the influence of various factors, including energy source availability, weather conditions, and policy changes.

Rydberg Photonics: Combining the Best of Both Worlds for the Next Quantum Revolution,"We are a group of physics, electrical, and computer engineers, and computer scientists who work on a novel interdisciplinary field of atom-nanophononics at the interface of atomic physics and quantum Nano-photonics. Our goal is to combine the best of both worlds to enable integrable, scalable, and robust quantum technologies on a chip like the electronic chips we are using daily. In our lab, we are working with Rydberg excitons, i.e. highly-excited giant atom-like systems in solid states. The electron wavefunctions of such excitons can be as large as microns, making them some of the most unique quantum objects that have such macroscopic sizes. Due to their large size, Rydberg excitons interact with each other strongly via the long-range van der Waals force. In our Quantum Nano-Photonics (QNP) lab, we utilize high-resolution laser spectroscopy techniques at cryogenic temperature mainly developed in the atomic physics field to study these Rydberg excitons and measure their interactions. Later we make Nano-photonic circuits composed of the waveguide, resonators, and beam splitters and combine them with Rydberg excitons to control the properties of these highly excited atoms on the chip scale. We also use pulsed laser spectroscopy techniques to excite these Rydberg excitons momentarily and study their relaxation and time dynamics. Further, we combine this technique with high-resolution fast microscopy to map the exciton dynamics and propagation spatially.

SCALE HI-AP: Interconnect Schemes for 3D Heterogeneous Integration and Advanced Packaging,"Research Areas: Heterogeneous Integration and Advanced Packaging, Interconnect technologies, thin-film materials Description As the demand for high performance computing increases, interconnect and die attach materials are needed to meet the requirements of 0.5 ?m line width, sub-10 ?m bump pitch, high I/O density, and power density for 1 nm Silicon Node and beyond (Figure 1).  Cu-pillar or micro-bump technology with hybrid bonding has achieved sub-1 ?m bump pitch posing several benefits such as increased I/O density, increased bandwidth, improved 3D stacking, enhanced power efficiency, and reduced parasitics and thermal resistance attributed to the absence of underfill.

Additionally, CLTs have no moving parts, which makes them affordable, easy to maintain, and more reliable than pumped cooling systems. Despite these advantages, CLTs face challenges related to operational flow instabilities that cause undesired fluctuations in temperature, flow rate, and pressure which shorten the life of the CLT. Geyser boiling instabilities (GBIs) are known to occur in small-diameter CLTs with low-pressure fluids. While GBI has been studied extensively in reflux thermosyphons, there are few studies that investigate GBI in CLTs. This project is an experimental exploration of GBI in a small-diameter CLT with the aim of developing a predictive model for the onset of geyser boiling.

However, different materials have different levels of shielding against different radiation sources. In this project, we will devise a hybrid shielding material to protect against multiple sources of radiation (e.g., neutrons and protons).

SCALE RH: Modeling radiation effects on semiconductor diodes,"Research Areas: Microelectronics, Radiation Hardening, Semiconductor Modeling, Electron Emission, Space-charge Limited Current, Theory, Device Reliability Description One of the important limits for semiconductor device operation is the space-charge limit, which corresponds to the maximum allowed current before no more electrons can be emitted into a diode. This limit is given by the Mott-Gurney law in a trap-free solid or the Mark-Helfrich law for a solid with traps distributed exponentially in energy. Because ionizing radiation will create electrons and ions in a semiconductor device, this project will involve elucidating the effect of these charges on these limits. This may include using simulations to characterize behavior or adapting analytic theories to include ionizing radiation effects.

SGLT2 Inhibitors for the Treatment of Cardiomyopathy in Duchennes Muscular Dystrophy,"Duchenne?? Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients each carry one of many different X-linked mutations of the dystrophin gene, resulting in no dystrophin synthesis, and it leads to premature loss of ambulatory mobility, respiratory distress, left ventricle (LV) dilation, low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), increase of LV volume, arrhythmia, sudden cardiac death (SCD) and all-cause mortality. Survival is very low after 35 years of age. Ischemic Heart Failure with reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF) is common, where patients have increased the incidence of arrhythmia, SCD and all-cause mortality. Despite completely different etiology and rate of disease progression, Duchenne?? cardiomyopathy and HFrEF have similar cardiac dysfunction phenotypes and outcomes. New HF drugs that block the sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 (SGLT2) in the kidney proximal tubules, called SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dramatically improves cardiac function, structure, morbidity and mortality in HFrEF patients (without diabetes). SGLT2i treatment of various rodent models of ischemic HFrEF or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with low LVEF, also produced cardiac function and structural benefits. Mechanistically, SGLT2i blocks increase natriuresis and diuresis, reducing blood volume, peripheral vascular resistance, cardiac preload and afterload leading to improved cardiac performance. SGLT2i treatment elevated production of ketone bodies (beta-hydroxybutyrate) providing an additional source of cardiac fuel. They reduce cardiomyocyte apoptosis, aberrant ion channel expression, increase cell survival and function. The student will work to quantify (i) heart function and structure in the mouse D2.mdx cardiomyopathy model and on (ii) survival and function in IPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with various mutations of dystrophin.

Solid State Environmentally Friendly Fire Extinguisher Propellant,"With the phase-out of Halon usage for aviation fire protection, the aerospace industry needs to identify solutions that will help protect the cargo bay.  Halon alternative research to date has not identified a system that can be similarly sized to current systems impacting the weight and fuel consumption.  The use of chemically inert gases such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide mitigates regulatory risks such as proposed PFAS (per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substance) restrictions.  The weight and size of inert fire suppression systems using relatively heavy gas cylinders are not attractive for aerospace applications.  The purpose of this project is to identify, synthesize and conduct proof-of-concept testing for solid-state propellants that generate inert gaseous products such as nitrogen and carbon dioxide (with insignificant levels of toxic or harmful bi-products) for use in aircraft cargo bay fire suppression systems. This research topic explores the development of these propellants.

Summer Research on AI in Surgery,"Our team is offering SURF projects for 1-2 highly motivated students with an interest in clinical applications of AI in medicine and surgery and a strong background in either technical fields (i.e., Computer Science, Data Science, Electrical/Computer Engineering) and/or biomedical fields (i.e., Pre-medical Track, Biomedical Engineering). Ideal candidates meet the following expectations: * Basic programming skills (Python, pytorch, numpy) * Interest in clinical applications of Artificial Intelligence * Ability to work independently and in a team setting and communicate effectively The SURF project and specific tasks for the student will be discussed in detail before the start of SURF. Contribution to either of the lab's ongoing research projects is possible. The SURF student(s) will work closely with a graduate mentor during the fellowship and will work on an independent/standalone sub-project. General information about the lab: The Translational Medical Image Computing (TMIC) Lab led by Dr. Kolbinger uses computational approaches to extract actionable knowledge from clinical datasets in the fields of surgery and interventional medicine. Our interdisciplinary research focuses on developing AI-based tools for surgery and evaluating these tools in early-phase clinical trials, thereby translating computational advancements into tangible patient benefits. Ultimately, our goal is to translate technological innovations, such as Artificial Intelligence, into clinically valuable tools for medical decision support. By doing so, our research strives to personalize treatment approaches and make surgeries and medical care safer and more effective. The lab's research addresses two key areas: (1)	Prediction of disease trajectories and outcomes: By predicting disease courses and outcomes from routinely available data acquired at earlier timepoints, we develop prediction models that help allocate the right treatment to the right patient at the right time to minimize complications and maximize patients' quality of life. (2)	Intraoperative decision support for increased safety and accuracy of minimally invasive surgeries: While computational image analysis is already clinically approved in fields like radiology or endoscopy, its application to surgical video has so far resulted in negligible patient benefit. Our team develops applications related to surgical safety and accuracy, for example visualization of vulnerable structures like blood vessels and nerves during surgeries and evaluates these systems in clinical routine. Our overarching goal is to integrate Artificial Intelligence-based image analysis into minimally invasive surgical systems and thereby set new standards for patient care. The TMIC Lab currently comprises three graduate and seven undergraduate researchers. Methodologies that all team members will interact with comprise advanced Artificial Intelligence methods for imaging and tabular data analysis, clinical imaging methods (i.e., MRI, CT, video data), advanced statistics, data visualization, conceptualization of and contribution to user studies and clinical research, and qualitative studies.",West Lafayette,"Big Data/Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, Deep Learning, Learning and Evaluation, Medical Science and Technology",No citizenship requirements,No Major Restriction,Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering,Fiona Kolbinger,https://fionakolbinger.github.io/
Super-Resolution Optical Imaging through Scatter and Optomechanics with Nanostructured Membranes,"Two projects are available. The first project involves the investigation of enhancing optical imaging and sensing capabilities using motion in structured illumination. Conventional optical imaging has a theoretical limit on its spatial resolution, to about one half of the wavelength, and many situations can benefit from higher resolution. In addition, it is challenging to image through scattering media. The project would involve investigating methods of imaging and sensing through scatter involving structured light. Some work will involve performing experiments with lasers and optical imaging elements, with either cameras or single photon counting detectors, and then using the data to extract information about hidden objects. The project could also involve simulations performed using electromagnetic finite element analysis (FEM) methods to concurrently verify experimental results. This work has a diverse set of potential applications including biological imaging, sensing defects in semiconductors, and imaging through fog. The second project relates to optomechanics, here meaning the study of the mechanical properties of light. The group?? work includes theoretical and numerical modeling of light-matter interactions, as well as experimental work involving thin membranes.

Topology Hiding Secure Computation,"Traditionally, secure distributed computing (SDC) systems assume that the communication network is a complete graph; i.e., there are point-to-point (P2P) channels between every pair of nodes. As we consider SDC systems for distributed CPS systems, this assumption does not hold: Due to restrictions such as line of sight (LOS) communication or simply to reduce energy consumption, distributed CPS systems may form connected graphs, but they can be far away from being a clique. Moreover, the communication network could itself contain sensitive information that the system may wish to hide. For instance, consider the following example: Satellites of different government states may wish to communicate important data while keeping the locations and number of their satellites mostly private. Topology hiding computation focuses on the SDC protocol that ensures that the adversary does not know any additional information about the topology of the communication graph beyond what may be computed from the SDC protocol output.

Tunable SIW Cavity Coupling Matrix Synthesis and Optimization,"Abstract: Resonant cavities are widely used in tunable filters, diplexers, couplers, and other RF/microwave components [1]. Some of these devices are frequency reconfigurable as they possess a mechanical or electrical tuning mechanism to change the resonant frequency of each cavity. Aligning all the cavities to the same resonant frequency is challenging as their response depends on the other coupled resonators. Hence, an algorithm to determine the optimum point from the given measurement is needed to reduce the time to tune the device. The undergraduate researcher will perform RF simulations and/or measurements of a cavity-based device with a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA). The multi-port coupling matrix of the device will be synthesized from the S-parameter data [2] and then compared to the ideal coupling matrix. An optimization algorithm will be developed to predict the changes needed in the tuning for each cavity. Finally, the undergraduate researcher will integrate the algorithm into the MATLAB open-source ARES tool [3]. Previous RF knowledge is encouraged but not required as the graduate mentor will teach the undergraduate researcher the needed background. [1] M. F. Hagag, R. Zhang and D.

Using AI to Predict Health Outcomes in Single Ventricle Patients,"A single ventricle (SV) heart is a serious condition that some babies are born with. In an SV heart, one of the two main pumping chambers of the heart is too small and does not work well. Without treatment, many babies with this condition would not survive.

However, even after surgery, the hearts of adult SV patients are still at risk of problems. SV patients are regularly monitored, and their health information is recorded in electronic health records (EHRs). These records include information like body weight, lab test results, heart imaging, and medications. The Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) has collected over 1,000 records from studies on SV patients.

Using Resistor Networks to Predict Critical Exponents in Mott Metal-Insulator Transition Materials,"Mott materials such as vanadium dioxide exhibit a drop in resistivity of up to a factor of 100,000, just above room temperature.  This is known as the Mott insulator-to-metal transition.  However, rather than transitioning all at once, the material displays intricate pattern formation, and the conducting regions form a fractal structure.  The student will calculate the macroscopic resistance associated with such fractal structures, by developing a resistor network model.  This will then be used to predict the power law behavior of resistance avalanches during the transition, and compared directly with experiments.",West Lafayette,Material Modeling and Simulation,No citizenship requirements,Physics,Physics and Astronomy,Erica Carlson,https://www.physics.purdue.edu/~erica
Using network science for precision learning intervention,"The goal of this project is to develop precision learning intervention technology that leverages semantic network science to support early language learning and early intervention for developmental language disorder (DLD).  DLD affects approximately 7% of the population, and results in lifelong risks for poor biomedical,  educational, and professional outcomes, leading to tremendous costs to individuals and society. Our group seeks to combine recent theoretical and technical advances to develop methods for early identification and intervention of this common, yet understudied condition.  Student will participate in coding / development of automated tools that tune early language learning targets according to the knowledge of the learner and will help pilot and assess efficacy of different intervention approaches. Student will work with senior members of the lab to develop and acquire data to support ongoing project development.",West Lafayette,"Big Data/Machine Learning, Learning and Evaluation, Medical Science and Technology, Other",No citizenship requirements,No Major Restriction,"Speech, Language, and Hearing Sciences",Arielle Borovsky,N/A
Video analytics for dairy feed management,"Video analytics and computer vision have the ability to fundamentally change animal agriculture by providing real-time analysis of operations on animal farms. In this project, we will focus on feed management. Potential projects include automating a video system to estimate the feed intake of individual dairy cattle, and automating a video system that assesses the texture consistency of feed during the mixing and preparation processes. These video systems need to be robust and accurate even in challenging environments with various illumination and shadows. The goal of this summer project is to explore computer vision methods to incorporate into these systems. The student will implement and conduct experiments using computer vision methods applied to a relevant set of videos. Depending on the project, the student may need to label with some videos with corresponding ground truth.  The student will discuss their updates at weekly meetings and will present their findings with a written report and oral presentation. The student will end the summer with a greater understanding of how video analytics can assist precision agriculture, and particularly, dairy production.",West Lafayette,"Big Data/Machine Learning, Other",No citizenship requirements,Computer Science Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Engineering Technology,Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Amy Reibman,N/A
Visualizing mechanotransduction of subcellular metabolic signaling in progerin-expressing endothelial cells,"The human aging process increases the risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases that together account for the most common causes of death in United States. Nuclear lamina, a network of intermediate filaments located right underneath the nuclear envelope, is implicated in the aging process. It plays a critical role in the structural integrity of the nucleus as well as in connecting with cell cytoskeleton. A mutant truncated form of lamin called progerin is responsible for premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a crucial regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, significantly influencing aging by modulating metabolic pathways. In this project, we will use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging and visualize the activity of AMPK signaling in the nucleus, mitochondria, and cytoplasm in progerin-expressing endothelial cells under flow-induced shear stress. In this project, a student will be involved in a range of techniques essential for studying cell mechanics and live cell imaging. This includes cell culture, transfection (introducing plasmids into cells), advanced live cell imaging using the FRET technique, and image analysis and quantification of cell signaling activity.",Indianapolis,"Biological Characterization and Imaging, Cellular Biology, Medical Science and Technology",No citizenship requirements,No Major Restriction Biomedical Engineering Biology Cell Molecular and Developmental Biology Mechanical Engineering Biological Engineering - multiple concentrations,Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering,Sungsoo Na,N/A
